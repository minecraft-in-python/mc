Hello! In this project, i tried to make minecraft with only python. It didnt turn out well for now, but im sure it will be better in the future.

If having performance issues:
  Try lowering width and depth;
  Try using "Flat" instead of "Normal" world generation;
  Turn on performance mode.

If the project doesn't work, try running 'pip install -r ./requirements.txt' in Command Prompt while in 'mc-main' directory.
